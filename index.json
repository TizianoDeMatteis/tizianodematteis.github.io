The large design space is difficult to explore and characterize. To help the system designer disentangle this complexity, we present ExDe, a framework to systematically explore the design space of scheduling architectures and mechanisms.

In 2021, the global data center industry was responsible for around 1% of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. With more resource-intensive workloads, such as Large Language Models, gaining popularity, this percentage is expected to increase further. Therefore, it is crucial for data center service providers to become aware of and accountable for the sustainability impact of their design and operational choices. However, reducing the carbon footprint of data centers has been a challenging process due to the lack of comprehensive metrics, carbon-aware design tools, and guidelines for carbon-aware optimization. In this work, we propose FootPrinter, a first-of-its-kind tool that supports data center designers and operators in assessing the environmental impact of their data center. FootPrinter uses coarse-grained operational data, grid energy mix information, and discrete event simulation to determine the data center’s operational carbon footprint and evaluate the impact of infrastructural or operational changes. FootPrinter can simulate days of operations of a regional data center on a commodity laptop in a few seconds, returning the estimated footprint with marginal error. By making this project open source, we hope to engage the community in the development of methodologies and tools for systematically assessing and exploring the sustainability of data centers.","tags":[],"title":"FootPrinter: Quantifying Data Center Carbon Footprint","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aratz Manterola Lasa","Sacheendra Talluri","Tiziano De Matteis","Alexandru Iosup"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1713258841,"objectID":"af9a387716e0479c277398f3b0aaa311","permalink":"/publication/2024-icpe-datacenter-scheduler/","publishdate":"2024-04-16T09:14:01.671431Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-icpe-datacenter-scheduler/","section":"publication","summary":"Schedulers are a crucial component in datacenter resource management.

In this work, we study the programming abstractions offered by industrial schedulers, their shortcomings, and their related performance costs. We propose a general reference architecture for scheduler programming abstractions. Specifically, we analyze the programming abstractions of five popular industrial schedulers, understand the differences in their APIs, and identify the missing abstractions.

In this paper we show how to leverage multiple clock domains for computational subdomains on reconfigurable devices through data movement analysis on high-level programs.  We offer a novel view on multi-pumping as a compiler optimization --- a superclass of traditional vectorization. As multiple data elements are fed and consumed, the computations are packed temporally rather than spatially. The optimization is applied automatically using an intermediate representation that maps high-level code to HLS. Internally, the optimization injects modules into the generated designs, incorporating RTL for fine-grained control over the clock domains. We obtain a reduction of resource consumption by up to 50% on critical components and 23% on average. For scalable designs, this can enable further parallelism, increasing overall performance.

To achieve this goal, they are designed to scale out on large clusters of commodity machines. However, despite the efficient use of distributed architectures, they lack support to co-processors like graphical processing units (GPUs) ready to accelerate data-parallel tasks. The main reason for this lack of integration is that GPU processing and the streaming paradigm have different processing models, with GPUs needing a bulk of data present at once while the streaming paradigm advocates a tuple-at-a-time processing model. This paper contributes to fill this gap by proposing Gasser, a system for offloading the execution of sliding-window operators on GPUs. The system focuses on completely general functions by targeting the parallel processing of non-incremental queries that are not supported by the few existing GPU-based streaming prototypes. Furthermore, Gasser provides an auto-tuning approach able to automatically find the optimal value of the configuration parameters (i.e., batch length and the degree of parallelism) needed to optimize throughput and latency with the given query and data stream. The experimental part assesses the performance efficiency of Gasser by comparing its peak throughput and latency against Apache Flink, a popular and scalable streaming system. Furthermore, we evaluate the penalty induced by supporting completely general queries against the performance achieved by the state-of-the-art solution specifically optimized for incremental queries. Finally, we show the speed and accuracy of the auto-tuning approach adopted by Gasser, which is able to self-configure the system by finding the right configuration parameters without manual tuning by the users.","tags":null,"title":"GASSER: An Auto-Tunable System for General Sliding-Window Streaming Operators on GPUs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" FBLAS is a porting of the BLAS numerical library (http://www.netlib.org/blas/) for Intel FPGA platform.\nFBLAS provides two layers of abstraction:\nHLS modules, which can be integrated into existing hardware designs.

In recent years, a considerable effort has been made in empowering this programming model with features able to overcome shortcomings of early approaches concerning flexibility and performance. In this article, we demonstrate that the approach is flexible and efficient enough by applying it on 12 out of 13 PARSEC applications. Our analysis, conducted on three different multicore architectures, demonstrates that pattern-based parallel programming has reached a good level of maturity, providing comparable results in terms of performance with respect to both other parallel programming methodologies based on pragma-based annotations (i.e., Openmp and OmpSs) and native implementations (i.e., Pthreads).

Because of their popularity, skyline queries have been studied in terms of both sequential algorithms and parallel implementations for multiprocessors and clusters. Within the Data Stream Processing paradigm, traditional database queries on static relations have been revised in order to operate on continuous data streams. Most of the past papers propose sequential algorithms for continuous skyline queries, whereas there exist very few works targeting implementations on parallel machines.
