**Streaming Message Interface** is a a distributed memory HLS programming model for **FPGAs** that provides
the convenience of message passing for HLS-programmed hardware devices. Instead of bulk transmission, typical of message passing model, 
with SMI messages are **streamed** across the network during computation, allowing communication to be seamlessly integrated into pipelined designs.

This repository contains an high-level synthesis implementation of SMI targeting OpenCL and Intel FPGAs, and all the 
applications used for the evaluation perfomed in the paper: *"Streaming Message Interface: High-Performance Distributed Memory
Programming on Reconfigurable Hardware"*, Tiziano De Matteis, Johannes de Fine Licht, Jakub Ber√°nek, and Torsten Hofler. To appear in Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis, 2019 (SC 2019).
