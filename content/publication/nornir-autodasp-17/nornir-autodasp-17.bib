 abstract = {A desirable characteristic of modern parallel applications
is the ability to dynamically select the amount of resources to be
used to meet requirements on performance or power consumption.
In many cases, providing explicit guarantees
on performance is of paramount importance.
In streaming applications, this is related with the
concept of elasticity, i.e. being able to allocate
the proper amount of resources to match the current demand
as closely as possible. Similarly, in other scenarios, it may be useful
to limit the maximum power consumption of an application to do
not exceed the available power budget.
In this paper we propose Nornir, a customizable
C++ framework for autonomic and power-aware parallel applications on shared memory multicore machines. Nornir can be used by autonomic strategy designers
to implement new algorithms and by application users to enforce
requirements on their applications.},
