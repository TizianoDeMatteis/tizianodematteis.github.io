Hello!

I am an Assistant Professor in the [@Large Research group](https://atlarge-research.com/) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, working on Multiscale and Post-Moore Architectures for Distributed Computer Ecosystem.
Before, I was a PostDoc at the [SPCL Group](https://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich, working on reconfigurable hardware for 
High-Performance Computing. I received his MSc and Ph.D. from the University of Pisa. 

My principal research interests are related to Parallel and Distributed Computing with a particular focus on FPGAs for HPC, Data Stream Processing, and Energy Awareness in Parallel Computing. In approaching these topics my main objective is to provide the application programmer with high-level abstractions and tools to develop complex parallel software with reduced time-to-market.

<!-- I am a former member of [Parallel Programming Model Group](http://calvados.di.unipi.it/paragroup/) at University of Pisa. -->
