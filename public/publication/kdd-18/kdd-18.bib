 abstract = {This paper studies kplexes, a well known pseudo-clique model for network communities. In a kplex, each node can miss at most $k-1$ links. Our goal is to detect large communities in today's real-world graphs which can have hundreds of millions of edges. While many have tried, this task has been elusive so far due to its computationally challenging nature: kplexes and other pseudo-cliques are harder to find and more numerous than cliques, a well known hard problem. We present D2K, which is the first algorithm able to find large kplexes of very large graphs in just a few minutes. The good performance of our algorithm follows from a combination of graph-theoretical concepts, careful algorithm engineering and a high-performance implementation. In particular, we exploit the low degeneracy of real-world graphs, and the fact that large enough kplexes have diameter~2. We validate a sequential and a parallel/distributed implementation of D2K on real graphs with up to half a billion edges.},
