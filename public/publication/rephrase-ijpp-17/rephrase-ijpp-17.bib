 abstract = {We discuss the extended parallel pattern set identified within the EU-funded project RePhrase as a candidate pattern set to support data intensive applications targeting heterogeneous architectures. The set has been designed to include three classes of pattern, namely (1) core patterns, modelling common, not necessarily data intensive parallelism exploitation patterns, usually to be used in composition; (2) high level patterns, modelling common, complex and complete parallelism exploitation patterns; and (3) building block patterns, modelling the single components of data intensive applications, suitable for use---in composition---to implement patterns not covered by the core and high level patterns. We discuss the expressive power of the RePhrase extended pattern set and results illustrating the performances that may be achieved with the FastFlow implementation of the high level patterns.},
